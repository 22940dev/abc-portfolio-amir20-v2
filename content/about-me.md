# Who Am I?


I am a software engineer, people manager and technology visionary. Here is a brief bio about me. I am currently at [Quid](https://quid.com/) as [Director of Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirraminfar) for the web team. Quid web transforms million of data points to beautiful visualizations of information and data powered by big-data analytics.  

Previously, I worked at [Opower](https://opower.com/) leading the Outbound & [Engineers Efficiency](https://opower.com/products/energy-efficiency/) team. Opower IPOâ€™ed in [2014](http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/opower-inc-756492-74761) and acquired by Oracle in [2016](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-buys-opower-050216.html). For a short time, I left Opower to start my own company, [Tilofy](http://www.tilofy.com/), with friends. Tilofy is a real-time search engine which indexes millions of social media content to power nearby insights.

You can find me active on Github working on [phantomjs-node](https://github.com/amir20/phantomjs-node) or my [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/419075/amir-raminfar) account which I am often active.
