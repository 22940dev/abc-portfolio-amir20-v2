# Hey, there!

I am a passionate software engineer who loves learning new things. I live in city of San Francisco and enjoy the outdoors and boxing! I am currently [Director of Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirraminfar) for the Outbound and [Engineers Efficiency](https://opower.com/products/energy-efficiency/) program at [Opower](https://opower.com/). Recently, I had a chance to pilot a [self-selection](http://nomad8.com/opower-case-study-self%C2%AD-selection-pilot/) event at Opower.  While I work on my leadership skills at work, I am a little nerd at home. I keep my technical skills up to date by protoyping services in Docker and front-end frameworks ReactJS and Redux.

On my spare time, I work on [phantomjs-node](https://github.com/amir20/phantomjs-node) which is an open source project that has gotten a lot of traction recently.

I have worked at larger companies like AOL where I was senior software engineer on [AOL.com](http://aol.com/). Most recently, I was a founder at [Tilofy](http://www.tilofy.com/) where we indexed millions of documents to power a real-time search engine.
